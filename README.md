# Web Coding Challenge

## Idea of the app
The task is to implement an app that lists shops.


## Technologies to use

- Python/Django
  - Backend : Django
  - Frontend : VueJS, Bootstrap
  - Database : MySQL | SQLite | MongoDB

- Git & Git Flow

- Any additional libraries you want


## Features
- As an Administrator, I can promote other users to administrator
- As an Administrator, I can load shops to the database, from an uploaded json file (shops.json provided).
- As a User (or Administrator), I can sign up using my email & password
- As a User (or Administrator), I can sign in using my email & password
- As a User (or Administrator), I can display the list of shops
- As a User, I can like a shop, so it can be added to my preferred shops
  - Acceptance criteria: liked shops shouldnâ€™t be displayed on the main page
- As a User, I can display the list of preferred shops
- As a User, I can remove a shop from my preferred shops list




## Mockups

(Note that the "dislike" button will be displayed but not actually do anything.)
![Main Page - List of shops sorted by popularity (popularity is the number of users who "like" the shop)](mockups/all_shops.png)





![My Preferred Shop page - List of my "liked" shops](mockups/my_preferred_shops.png)



(Note that the "make user" button will be displayed but not actually do anything. Also note the "Admin Settings" link is only shown to Administrators.)
![Admin Settings page - List of Administrators and Users](mockups/admin_settings.png)







## Application Data

A json file with 100 shops is provided. Administrators should be able to import this data into your application back-end.


## What we're looking for
- Clean, modular code structure, programming best practices, legibility.
- Clean git commit history with feature and release branches following git flow best practices
- Documentation, or how do we get your code running on our machine?


## Once you're done with the app

Put the code of your project on Github and send the URL to matt.gabrenya@gmail.com
